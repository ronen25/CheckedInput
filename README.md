# CheckedInput
A Python module for CLI programs that require input to be checked properly

I wrote this module because I needed to write command-line programs that checked their input. For example, one program needed to input numbers in a certain range, while the other needed to display a list of choices, and verify that the user input matches what is allowed by that list of choices.

Writing input loops every time was tedious, so I decided to write a module for that.
